# Los Pedros Customs

### Project Overview
This project was developed in September 2024, in collaboration with classmates, as part of a series of challenges to learn JavaScript. We created a website for Los Pedros Customs, an auto repair shop, with a tool for generating budget estimates. The website was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Challenges & Solutions
### Vehicle Selection System:
The first challenge was to implement a system that allows users to select the brand, model, and year of a vehicle.
To achieve this, we integrated the FIPE Table API, which dynamically fetches the required data, enabling the selection system to work efficiently.

## Responsive Design:
The second challenge was to make the website fully responsive, ensuring it provides a seamless user experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
We successfully implemented a responsive layout using CSS media queries and flexible grid structures.

## Technologies Used:
HTML5: Structuring the content of the website.
CSS3: Styling and ensuring responsive design.
JavaScript: Adding interactivity and API integration.
FIPE Table API: Used to retrieve vehicle data (brand, model, year) dynamically.

## Features
Dynamic vehicle selection system using FIPE Table API.
A budget estimation tool for auto repair services.
Fully responsive design, adapting to different screen sizes.

## Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/los-pedros-customs.git

## Status
This project was completed as a learning challenge and is fully functional. Future improvements may include expanding the budget tool and adding more interactive features.
